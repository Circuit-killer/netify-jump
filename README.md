### What is Netify Jump?

Netify Jump is a software-based system that effectively transforms your computer into a WiFi router and/or repeater. 
<br><br>
Netify Jump can broadcast WiFi right from your PC, so that any other WiFi-enabled device can get online. In addition using the built in "File Jump" service devices can beam files to and from other connected devices. 

### Why did I make it?

I feel software such as this should not require large license fees & paid subscriptions for the newest version every year. I believe in open source software and the power that is the community. (I also needed to make a hotspot)

### Requirements

 - PC running Windows 8.1 or above. <br>
Mac, Linux & Windows 7+ support is in the works and coming soon!
 - WiFi adaptor and/or dongle.
 - English set as system language (alternative language support in next release)
