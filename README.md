### What is Netify Jump?
---------------------------

Netify Jump is a software-based system that does everything your hardware router can do (and some things it canâ€™t). Netify Jump can broadcast WiFi right from your PC, so that any other WiFi-enabled device can get online. 

### Why did I make it?
---------------------------

I feel software such as this should not require large license fees & paid subscriptions for the newest version every year. I belive in open source software and the power that is the community. 

### Getting Started

- `npm install`

To run the app in development:

- `npm start`

Running `npm start` will download and install [Electron](http://electron.atom.io/).

### Building & Release

- `npm run release`
