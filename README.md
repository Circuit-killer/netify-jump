### What is Netify Jump?

Netify Jump is a software-based system that effectively transforms your computer into a WiFi router and/or repeater. 
<br><br>
Netify Jump can broadcast WiFi right from your PC, so that any other WiFi-enabled device can get online. In addition using the built in "File Jump" service devices can beam files to and from other connected devices. 

### Why did I make it?

I feel software such as this should not require large license fees & paid subscriptions for the newest version every year. I believe in open source software and the power that is the community. (I also needed to make a hotspot)

### Can i run it?

Netify Jump requires a computer running Windows 7 or above with a wifi adaptor and/or dongle. <br>
Mac & Linux support is in the works and coming soon!
